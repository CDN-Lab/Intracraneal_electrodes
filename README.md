# Subjective Value Sampling
The following jupyter notebooks create a trial choice set for  a Risky and Ambigous Decision Making task in which patients  choose between a certain monetary outcome (loss or gain) and playing a lottery with varying probabilities of wins or losses (risky trials) and varying degrees of uncertainty (ambiguous trials).

In the calibration session the trials presented were pre-specified alternatvies. We then fit a computational expected utility model to the behavior in the calibration session and used the resulting model parameters to then redesign the trials for subsequent sessions to sample the same subjective value difference (SV of the lottery - SV of the safe option) repeatedly using different combinations of certain and lottery options.
